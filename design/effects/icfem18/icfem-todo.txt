* Need to trim down to 16 pages
* Want to add maybe a page talking about the soundness proofs
* Where we introduce the static rules for unannotated code and then jump to
  the import expression in annotated code, we should instead introduce the
  static rules for annotated code (as this will give us an opportunity to
  explain the syntax of the Gamma |- hat-e: tau-e with epsilon judgements
* We somewhat repeat "Related work" stuff in the intro and the conclusion.
  Probably doesn't need to be in both, just in the intro.
* In the grammar, not all forms have a description beside naming them (in
    the annotated grammar).
* "Later we will need to annotate contexts" --- i'm pretty sure this is only
    for the proof of soundness, which may be omitted in part or in whole
    in the final paper, so maybe we don't need to define annot(Gamma, epsilon).
