* Need to trim down to 16 pages
* Want to add maybe a page talking about the soundness proofs
* Where we introduce the static rules for unannotated code and then jump to
  the import expression in annotated code, we should instead introduce the
  static rules for annotated code (as this will give us an opportunity to
  explain the syntax of the Gamma |- hat-e: tau-e with epsilon judgements
* We somewhat repeat "Related work" stuff in the intro and the conclusion.
  Probably doesn't need to be in both, just in the intro.
